# How to read this tutorial

This tutorial is designed to help you getting used to opto language. This is not a reference page that contains every information of Opto, but is written in human-friendly way to guid you understand and start using the Opto.

I recommend you start from the beginning (Basic concepts) since starts building up language concepts from the first chapter. All language features will be explained before chapter 7, but I highly recommend you going through chapter 7 to see how Opto comes into play in real world.

### Index

1. **Chapter 1 (Basic concepts)** describes basic concepts you need to understand to use opto language.
2. **Chapter 2 (Understanding compile-time language features)** explains using basic functionalities in Opto such as let bindings, lists, tuples and type casting
3. **Chapter 3 (Functions (Closures))** dives into functions in Opto. It will tell you how functions are constructed, and how they are composed together.
4. **Chapter 4 (Managing control flow)** Explains how control flow is used in Opto. It explains if/else statement, throwing exceptions, and print statements.
5. **Chapter 5 (Runtime expressions)** Explains runtime expressions. It compares runtime expressions to compile time expressions, and gives you understanding of how it can come together with compile time expressions.
6. **Chapter 6 (Helper functions)** Gives you list of builtin helper functions that can be used in Opto. Helper functions can be very useful when we write complex kernels.
7. **Chapter 7 (Putting it all together)** Puts all concepts explained in previous chapters, and explains the process by writing 'add.opto' kernel that adds two tensors element-wise.
