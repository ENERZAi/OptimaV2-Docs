# Introduction

Opto language is designed to let you create any type of layer you wish, while preserving inference performance and human readability.
Most of layers used in OptimaV2 is implemented using Opto. You can even design your own kernel and add it to OptimaV2 using Opto. Opto is one of the key feature of OptimaV2, providing scalability and flexibility while preserving fast performance and human readability.

Opto is designed to be 
1. Easy to understand, write layers
2. Simple and concise
3. Difficult to make mistakes

Opto achieves these with concept called 'functional programming'. Which means, program is constructed by applying and composing functions. Therefore, Opto code is deterministic (for most cases) and prevents errors from side effects from mutable variables or memory errors from its design.

If you are new to functional programming, this concept might not familiar to you. But once you start writing in functional language such as Opto, You will feel its true horsepower.

### Current status

Until now, Opto language has come far way. However, Opto is still in development phase. Therefore, there can be potential bugs or imcomplete features. Here are some features and enhanvements that is yet to come, but is under its way.

1. Hindly milner type inference
2. Runtime print statements and debugging functions
3. Compile time interpreter performance improvements

We have [Issue tracker](http://remote.enerzai.com:18080/issues) for tracking bugs and errors in Opto and OptimaV2. You can observe bugs that should be fixed, or if you find one, please report them on our issue tracker with how we can reproduce it, or you can contact us directly to Optima team.
